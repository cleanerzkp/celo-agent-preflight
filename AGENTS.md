# AGENTS

## Project Focus

This workspace is for the Celo Frontier grant and the Celo agent infrastructure MVP. For implementation work, prefer the installed Celo skills before inventing local patterns:

- Use `8004` for ERC-8004 agent identity, reputation, registry reads/writes, and grant evidence around agent discoverability.
- Use `x402` for HTTP-native agent payments and paid API/service flows.
- Use `evm-foundry`, `viem`, `celo-rpc`, and `contract-verification` for the smart contract and deployment path.
- Use `celo-stablecoins`, `fee-abstraction`, and `evm-wallet-integration` when stablecoin settlement or wallet UX matters.
